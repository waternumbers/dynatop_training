## Target Audience

Since this is a course on hydrological modelling using a R software package
it is presumed that you have at least a basic knowledge of hydrology and
R. Useful primers for R can be found on multiple websites such as that of
[Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) or on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) but
complete knowledge of their contents is not expected.

## Software

altering the R scripts is required. Installation instructions for R are available from
[CRAN]{https://cran.r-project.org/} for Linux, Windows and Mac. A version
newer then R4.1 is required. 

While it is possible to complete the course using the built in `R` GUIs for
Windows and Mac it is recomended to to install editor with syntax
highlighting. Popular choices include the [Rstudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), VSCode
(Instructions

or emacs with [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=home).

For completing the example of developing dynatop an installation of the git
