This is a course on hydrological modelling using a R software package.
It is presumed that you have at least a basic knowledge of hydrology and
ideally some experience of R.

Useful primers for R can be found on multiple websites such as that of
[Hadley Wickham](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/) or on
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.pdf) but
complete knowledge of their contents is not expected.

## Software

To make use of the examples on which the course is based requires

- An installation of R 4.1.0 or above
- A suitable text editor for altering the R scripts.

Installation instructions for R are available from
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) for Linux, Windows and Mac.

While it is possible to complete the course using the built in R GUIs for
Windows and Mac it is recomended to to install editor with syntax
highlighting. Popular choices include the [Rstudio
IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download), VSCode
(Instructions
[here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/2021/01/setup-visual-studio-code-to-run-r-on-vscode-2021/))
or emacs with [ESS](https://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=home).

For completing the final part of the course which focuses on developing
dynatop further software is required. 

- An installation of the git version control system
- Tools for building R packages which include source code
- An account on [github](https://github.com/)

Details on installing git can be found on the softwares [webpage](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
.

The most efficent method of installing the tools required for building R
packages depends upon the platform:

- Windows: a single toolchain
 [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) is available.
- Mac: requires Apple Xcode and GNU Fortran compiler. Details of the GNU
  Fortran compiler version and other libraries that may be required are
  provided on [CRAN](https://mac.r-project.org/tools/)
- Linux: ensure that the gcc and gcc-c++ compliers are installed
