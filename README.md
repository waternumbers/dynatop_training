# dynatop_training

This repository will contain training material relating to the dynatop and dynatopGIS packages

So far the scope of the training should ideally cover:

- Documentation of what trainees should have/bring
- Some Dynamic TOPMODEL theory
   - Need to know enough to have terminology and understanding of the solution scheme
- Overview of stages in model creation/execution
   - role of different packages 
- GIS processing and model creation
   - Including appropriate resolution of DEM and channel network
- Processing and setting up inputs
- Simulation of the model, changing parameters, efficient Monte-Carlo runs
   - Cover use of HPC/HEC with parrallel runs (but won't be system specific at the call level)
- Extracting and visualising states, channel inflow and flow series at gauges
- Altering code and rebuilding the R package
   - Crash course in R package structure, self documenting etc
   - Simple example (new tranmissivity profile?)
      - develop, document, test
   - git and submission of alterations to main repository
