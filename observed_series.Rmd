It is expected that the precipitation and potential evapotranspiration inputs series are
given in $m$ accrued over the proceeding time step. So if the data has a time
step $\Delta t$ the value given at $t+\Delta t$ is accrued in the interval between time $t$
and time $t+\Delta t$.

The data series for the diffuse and point inputs used in the channel routing
should be in $m^3/s$. In the channel HRU solution the value given at time
$t+\Delta t$ is presumed to be constant over the interval $t$ to $t+\Delta t$.
