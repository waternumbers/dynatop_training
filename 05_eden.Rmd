title: "River Eden Example"
---

The first half of the training course is working through an example
application based on the Eden Catchment in Cumbria, UK (Figure. At the Sheepmount
gauging station downstream of Carlisle, which is the lowest
monitored point in the catchment, the total area is 2400 km$^2$.

The River Eden and its main tributaries
including the Rivers Eamont, Irthing, Petteril and Caldew link a number of significant
areas for runoff generation which include the northern and eastern parts of the Lake
District; areas of the Northern Pennines and Kielder Forest. These areas are typified by
high annual rainfall totals and steep terrain. Moreover the confluences of two of
these main tributaries lie within the Carlisle urban area resulting in a complex situation
where significant inflows on any tributary may result in flooding.
In January 2005 Carlisle was flooded by an event with an estimated 0.0067 Annual
Exceedance Probability (AEP) at the Sheepmount Gauge (Clarke 2005; Day 2005).
Subsequently to this events in 2010, and particularly 2009, came close to over topping
the main flood defences. The significance of the 2005 flood, combined with a post
event survey of 263 water or wrack marks, has resulted in multiple inundation model
studies (Neal et al. 2009; Horritt et al. 2011; Fewtrell et al. 2011) and
modelling (Leedan et al. 2013, Smith et al. 2013).
